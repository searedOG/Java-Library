/ Objects in java are called classes (Java is object oriented)

/ "Hello World Program"

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

// Java is case sensitive
// First line defines the class
// main = Name of the method
// public = any class can access it, or person
// static = run this method without creating an instance of main 
// void = Method returns no value


// Line 3 (Hello World)
// system = a pre-defined class that java provides us, and holds some useful methods and variables
// out = A static variable within system that represenets the output of your program (stdout = standard output)
// println = A method that is used to print a line


//String = defined in other places (Maybe?)
